**Abstractive Text Summarization using HuggingFace Transformers**

---
 Overview
PegasusSummarizer is an end-to-end pipeline for abstractive text summarization of conversational data using the Pegasus-SAMSum model from Hugging Face. It follows modular, MLOps-inspired architecture with YAML-based configuration, and evaluates performance using ROUGE metrics.
